### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc. 
- When asking the user for sensitive information - you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- You should use Next.js as it works best with Vercel. 
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally. 
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.
- You must define and follow a consistent theme (colors, typography, spacing).
- Do not use arbitrary colors; all colors must belong to a defined colour scheme.
- Use a limited color palette (primary, secondary/accent, background, surface, text).
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background in all themes.
- If multiple themes are used (e.g. light/dark), they must be consistent in hierarchy and spacing.
- Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning (e.g. errors, warnings, success states).
